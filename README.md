## Overview:
A FIN is a neural network with weights that are initialized to reliably approximate one or more closed-form statistical features, such as Shannonâ€™s entropy. This work demonstrates that FINs (and FIN ensembles) can provide best-in-class performance for a variety of downstream signal processing and inference tasks, while using less data and requiring less fine-tuning compared to other networks of similar (or even greater) representational power.
