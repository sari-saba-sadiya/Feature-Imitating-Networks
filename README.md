Code for the paper ["Feature Imitating Networks"](https://github.com/sari-saba-sadiya/Feature-Imitating-Networks/blob/main/FINS_ICASSP22_arXiv.pdf) by Sari Saba-Sadiya, Tuka Alhanai, and Mohammad M Ghassemi. FINs for going deep (learning).

## Overview:
A FIN is a neural network with weights that are initialized to reliably approximate one or more closed-form statistical features, such as Shannonâ€™s entropy. This work demonstrates that FINs (and FIN ensembles) can provide best-in-class performance for a variety of downstream signal processing and inference tasks, while using less data and requiring less fine-tuning compared to other networks of similar (or even greater) representational power.
